<h1>#Important Notes:</h1>

1.No redux or context was used yet.<br/>
2.No login or register form is included.<br/>
3.Statistic data is mostly true/false due to my lack of medical test knowledge.<br/>
4.Database is included in db.json file inside src folder.<br/>
5.dx-react-grid-material-ui was used in addition to standard material-ui only due to my curiosity and can be easily changed to normal mui table or grid.<br/>

<h1>#Installation:</h1>

1.Inside project folder run `npm i` and wait for it to finish <br/>
2.Run `npm run server (it takes up 403 port) <br/>
3.Run `npm start` <br/>
