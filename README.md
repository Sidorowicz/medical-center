#Important Notes:

1.no redux or context was used yet.
2.no login or register form is included.
3.statistic data is mostly true/false due to my lack of medical test knowledge.
4.database is included in db.json file inside src folder
5.dx-react-grid-material-ui was used in addition to standard material-ui only due to my curiosity and can be easily changed to normal mui table or grid

#Installation:

1.Inside project folder run `npm i` and wait for it to finish
2.Run `npm run server (it takes up 403 port)
3.Run `npm start`
